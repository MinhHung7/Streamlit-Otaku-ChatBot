This is my first project about buidling an analysis app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

In order to test successfully, you need to use [anime-dataset-2023.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset?select=anime-dataset-2023.csv), which my team analyse in final project in **Data Science Programming**

with st.expander("Introduction"):
    st.markdown("""Welcome to the Anime 2023 Analysis & Machine Learning Hub, a comprehensive exploration of anime data through the power of data science and machine learning. This app is an integration of techniques learned in `Data Science Programming, Data Visualization, and Data Science Introduction` courses, where we analyze and model the Anime Dataset 2023.""")
    st.markdown("""Our journey begins with data preprocessing, where we clean, organize, and prepare the dataset to ensure it is ready for meaningful analysis. Following that, we delve into data visualization, using various graphical techniques to uncover hidden trends, relationships, and patterns within the dataset, such as correlations between anime genres, ratings, and production factors.""") 
    st.markdown("""Finally, we apply machine learning models to predict outcomes such as age ratings, recommend anime based on user preferences, and optimize production strategies. This app not only demonstrates the power of data science but also provides practical insights that can transform how we understand and interact with the anime industry.""")
