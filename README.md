# Hello there 🖐
This is my first project using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build a data analysis app. This app simulates our final project in **Data Science Programming**.

If you're curious about our final project, you can visit here [Final Project Data Science Programming](https://github.com/MinhHung7/Final_Project_DataScienceProgramming)
